## Description

*   `bot.py`: A Pyrogram bot that uses Gemini AI to categorize Telegram chats and organize them into folders.
*   `session.py`: A script to generate a Pyrogram session string for authentication.
*   `telegram_organizer.py`: A command-line tool to organize your Telegram chats into folders using the Pyrogram library and Google's Gemini AI.

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure you have the following:

*   Python 3.6 or higher
*   A Telegram account
*   A Google Cloud project with the Gemini AI API enabled and an API key
*   Environment variables set for API\_ID, API\_HASH, SESSION\_STRING, and GEMINI\_API\_KEY

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd clean-telegram
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your Telegram API credentials and Gemini API key:

    ```
    API_ID=<your_telegram_api_id>
    API_HASH=<your_telegram_api_hash>
    SESSION_STRING=<your_pyrogram_session_string>
    GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>
    ```

    You can obtain the API\_ID and API\_HASH from the [Telegram API development tools](https://my.telegram.org/apps).

    To get the SESSION\_STRING use `session.py`:

    ```bash
    python session.py
    ```

    Copy the generated session string from the console output or your Telegram saved messages.

    To get the GEMINI\_API\_KEY, enable the Gemini AI API in your Google Cloud project and create an API key.

## Usage

### `bot.py`

This script provides a Telegram bot that organizes your chats.

1.  **Run the bot:**

    ```bash
    python bot.py
    ```

2.  **Interact with the bot:**

    Start a private chat with your bot on Telegram and send the `/get` command. The bot will fetch your dialogues, categorize them using Gemini AI, and organize them into folders.

### `telegram_organizer.py`

This script provides a command-line interface to organize your chats.

1.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python telegram_organizer.py --organize
    ```

    Alternatively, run without the `--organize` to review the setup.

    ```bash
    python telegram_organizer.py
    ```

    The script will prompt you to confirm before organizing the chats.

## Detailed File Descriptions

### `bot.py`

This file contains the core logic for the Telegram bot.

*   It uses the `pyrogram` library to interact with the Telegram API.
*   It loads environment variables using the `dotenv` library.
*   It configures the Gemini AI API using the `google.generativeai` library.
*   It defines a command handler for the `/get` command, which fetches dialogues, categorizes them using Gemini AI, and organizes them into folders.
*   It uses colorama for colored logging.

### `session.py`

This file generates a session string for your Telegram account using the Pyrogram library.

*   It loads environment variables using the `dotenv` library.
*   It creates a Pyrogram client in memory and exports the session string.
*   It prints the session string to the console and sends it to your Telegram account.

### `telegram_organizer.py`

This file provides a command-line tool for organizing Telegram chats.

*   It uses the `pyrogram` library to interact with the Telegram API.
*   It loads environment variables using the `dotenv` library.
*   It configures the Gemini AI API using the `google.generativeai` library.
*   It fetches dialogues, categorizes them using Gemini AI, and organizes them into folders.
*   It uses colorama for colored logging.
*   It includes an argument parser for command-line options.

## Error Handling and Logging

The scripts include comprehensive error handling and logging using the `colorama` library for colored output. Errors and warnings are logged in red and yellow, respectively, while informational messages are logged in blue and successful operations are logged in green.

## Limitations

*   The accuracy of chat categorization depends on the quality of the Gemini AI model and the prompt used.
*   The number of folders created is limited to 7 to avoid exceeding Telegram's folder limits.
*   Rate limits imposed by the Telegram API may affect performance, especially when processing a large number of dialogues.
*   Gemini AI API usage is subject to Google's pricing and usage policies.
